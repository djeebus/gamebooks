# Speed & Engine Operation

a Hopper boat consumes one FU (fuel Unit) per hour for
normal travel. This includes moving about from area to area on
a planet, dropping from orbit (unless an unpowered glide is
used), or moving about in orbit (to or from a space station
and/or asteroid). On the planet, the boat can travel up to 10
land steps per hour.

Climbing from the surface of a planet to orbit consumes fuel
units equal to the gravity of the planet. For example, climbing
to orbit on a gravity 5 planet takes 5 FUs — all expended in that
hour. The engines of the Hopper boat are limited to a power of
9 — they cannot use more than 9 FU at a time, and thus the
boat is unable to climb from planets of 10 or higher gravity. The
only way to get a boat off such a planet is to carry it within a
starship, or use an orbital shuttle.

A Hopper boat can travel from one planet to another (or from
planet to asteroid area, or vice versa). However, it is not as fast
as a starship. The type of travel takes an entire day, and
consumes 10 FU.

Loading and unloading a boat from a starship is very easy, and
takes no extra time.
