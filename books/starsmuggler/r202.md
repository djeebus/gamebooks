# Cunning

Cunning is an ability that combines smooth talking, staying
cool, thinking fast in an emergency, rapidly figuring alternatives
when a plan is blocked, and generally outsmarting your
adversaries. Duke Springer is the only character with a Cunning
rating. The first time you play, roll 1d6 (one die) to obtain your
rating. If you have played before, you can adjust your Cunning
by one in each subsequent game. If you found the game too
difficult, or if you lost, increase your Cunning by one (+1). If you
wish more challenge, or if you won, decrease your Cunning by
one (-1). When you feel you have become an expert, trying
playing with a Cunning rating of 0! When an event calls for a
"Cunning roll," you roll one die and must get less than or equal
to your Cunning rating to succeed, unless some other
requirement is indicated.
