# Monetary System

the entire Pavonis sector uses a standard currency, technically
called Sector Exchange Units, commonly called "Sees" and
normally abbreviated "S." All prices are calculated in Sees
unless an event specifically indicates you can trade or barter.
Prices vary from system to system for the same item, normally
the base price is given and the actual price must be [computed](r229a)
([multiplier table](r241)).
