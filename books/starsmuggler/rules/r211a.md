# Capacity Units

all available space on a starship and on other vehicles is
measured in Capacity Units (CUs). Most people and materials
require CUs for storage and transport, given in the description
of the item (see r236 for reference). Unless otherwise
restricted, any type of space can be used for any type of
material. For example, you could have people in the Cargo Hold,
weapons in the Engineering space, extra Fuel Units in the Crew
Quarters, etc. if you desired. Due to the possibility of searches,
theft, and damage it is useful to record what is being carried
where.

Each person uses 1 CU of space, and each utility suit also uses
1 CU. A Person may carry (or drag) 2 CUs, not counting the
utility suit he or she wears â€” this allows a person to take a
disable individual to safety when wearing suits.
