# Daily Actions

At the start of each day, you either perform normal travel and
contact, or stay in place for RRR (Rest, Recuperation and
Repair). At the end of each day, you must check for breakdowns
of equipment, and after each 10-day week, make payments on
your loan. Each is explained in detail below. Time: each day has
ten (10) hours for activity. All events are timed in hours, or
sometimes take the rest of the day. If an event goes over the
normal limit, you automatically get extra hours that day to
finish it (an event will not carry over to the next day). Any other
people in your party either travel with you, or [stay behind](r220) doing little.
