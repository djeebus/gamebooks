# Buying, Selling, and Salaries

most events give specific costs or salaries for goods and
services. This price is normally listed as the base price in Sees
(S). The base price is modified by the [wealth code](r207) of the star
system, to given the actual price.

To determine actual price, roll 1d6 and compare it with the
system's wealth code on the [Base Price Multiplier Table](r241).
Multiply the result on this table by the base price to get the
actual price. For example, a sidearm with a base price of 5 S is
available in the Palatek system (wealth 30). With a 1d6 roll of
"1", the table indicates a multiplier of "x1", so the price is (5x1=)
5 S. If the 1d6 roll was "6" , the resulting multiplier is "x3", so
the actual cost is (5x3=) 15 S.

Premium Prices means increase the
wealth code one level (move down one row) and add one to the
1d6 roll (move to the right one column) to get the premium
price.

Devaluated Prices means decrease the wealth code one level 
(move up one row), and subtract one to the 1d6 (move to the 
left one column) roll to get the devaluated price.

Any premium or devalued price modifiers that move the result
off the table are ignored (i.e., stay within the limits of the table).
