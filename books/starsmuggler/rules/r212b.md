# Hyper charges

a starship uses hyper charges as "fuel" for jumps. The
Antelope class can hold up to six (6) hyper charges in special
spaces, which cannot be used to carry anything else (no CUs of
storage here), nor can regular CU be used for additional hyper
charges

A starship makes hyper drive jumps along standard routes, as
illustrated by the connections in r234. Each link between
systems is a single jump. A starship can make a "double jump"
and pass directly over a system for the next one along the route
(it doesn't stop or appear at the middle system). It is possible to
make a triple jump by passing over two systems and arriving at
the third. Hyper charge expenditure varies with the type of
jump:

| length      | charges                      |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| single jump | uses one (1) hyper charge    |
| double jump | uses three (3) hyper charges |
| triple jump | uses five (5) hyper charges  |

For example, using the standard star system connection
pattern (r234, pattern one), a jump from Regari to Palatek is a
single jump; from Regari to Byzantium or Imperia is a double
jump, while from Regari to Talitar is a triple jump. Nothing
bigger than a triple jump is possible, so the other systems
cannot be reached from Regari in a hyper jump
