# Land Areas

each planet is composed of two map tiles, joined in a circular
shape. The planet has various colored symbols on it, each
symbol is a "land area." Each symbol has a name indicating its
type, and additional codes for special facilities:

Symbol Colors denote entrance restrictions:

- White areas can be entered by any type of travel.
- Yellow areas cannot be entered by a starship or ship's boat, but any other form of travel is allowed.
- Red areas can only be entered on foot or in a commercial vehicle, no other form of travel is allowed.
- Purple areas only by starship, ship's boat, or orbital shuttle.

Area Names in white denote good air within the area, area
names in black denote normal planetary air (which may be
good, bad or none).

[b] after the name indicates [banking facilities](r232a) are present.

[m] after the name indicates [medical facilities](r231c) present.

Area Connectors are lines that indicate travel routes. You move
from area to area along these lines:

Short triple-line connector indicates one hour of travel time,
regardless of the means used, to move to the other area.
This symbol really indicates that the areas are touching, and
thus if both have good air in them, travel is possible between
without life support, even on a bad or no air planet.

Long single line connectors with a number indicate a larger
distance. The number is the distance in "land steps" between
areas. See [travel rules](r203a) for time needed to traverse a
land step.
