# Starship Hyper drive

star ships use hyper drive to move from one star system to
another. This means transportation is literally instantaneous,
but not without risk. There is a chance a ship using hyper drive
will "dissipate" on return to normal space, with its atoms
scattered through space. This risk is greater if the ship uses
hyper drive close to a high gravity source (such as near a
planet), or when the ship is damaged. When a starship jumps,
pursuit is impossible, since there is no way to tell which way the
ship went, or how far it is going. Therefore, once you make a
hyper jump, you are safe from all pursuits (assuming you
survive the jump). Of course, if you return to the star system,
you may now be "wanted" there!
