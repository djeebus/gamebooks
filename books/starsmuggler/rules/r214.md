# Hopper Class Ship's Boat

The standard ship's boat for merchant ships, including the
Antelope class, is the Hopper class. The boat is sealed for
operation in space or any atmosphere, but requires life support
units if the crew or passengers are without their own. The boat
consumes fuel units at a relatively high rate, and this is mainly
used for short excursions. It has folding wings, and may be
glide-landed without power (and thus without fuel use) on a
planet with atmosphere.

The Hopper class requires one person to operate, who must be
a qualified pilot (including starship pilots).
