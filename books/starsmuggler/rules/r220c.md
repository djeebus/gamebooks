# Isolated Persons

persons of your party may be left somewhere while you go
elsewhere. While isolated from you, the others cannot travel,
engage in work, combat, try for contact or other activities. The
only exception is that they may perform [RRR activities](r203c),
such as repair, preventive maintenance, or healing wounds. The
normal RRR encounter [may occur](r227a), and if it does,
they make no resistance to the event, and will be automatically
defeated in any combat.
Isolated individuals will consume life support and/or repair
units as necessary for their existence and tasks.
[Bodyguards](r221d) may not be voluntarily left in isolation
from you, but events may force them to become isolated.
