# Caches

some events can cost you much of your current possessions,
or cost considerable money. To avoid some of these results, you
can cache money or equipment at the end of any day. Caches
can only be formed if you did not travel that day.
When you later return to the area of the cache, you can spend
1d6 hours at the start of the day looking for it. Consult the
[Cache Table](r242) for the results. As a general rule, asteroids
are the best places to cache items.

Items that require life support will die unless left in a place
with life support, or placed within an activated [stasis unit](r212e). 
Items that require a continual operating cost in Sees
(such as robots) will automatically break down unless placed
within an activated [stasis unit](r212e).
