Duke Springer operates a small merchant starship of the
Antelope class. It has a hyper drive to allow "jumps" from one
star system to another, as well as a sub light propulsion system
for travel within a star system. It is streamlined, and can land
on or take off from planets, even those with an atmosphere. It
can carry a ship's boat, and mounts one weapons turret. The
ship can be controlled by a single individual (pilot/navigator),
but there are advantages to having [a larger crew](r221). Below
is a reference diagram of the starship, which can be
photocopied and used for notes, etc. The diagram shows [the
CUs](r211a) in each compartment or area of the ship, including:

- Pilot's Compartment: 2 CU.
- Crew Quarters: 16 CU.
- Gunnery Turret: 2 CU if starship guns installed, add 6 CU if
starship guns removed.
- Boat Hold: 40 CU if no ship's boat present; if boat is present, it
takes up all 40 CU, but there [may be room within the boat](r214).
- Main Cargo Hold: 60 CU.
- Engineering Compartment: 4 CU.

There are also [six concealed areas](r229b) numbered 1 to 6, each
being 1 CU. These are in cable runs, behind access panels, in
ventilation ducts, etc.
