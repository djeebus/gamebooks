# Characters

Each character in the game has three ratings: Marksmanship
("M"), Hand-to-Hand fighting ("F"), and Endurance ("E"). Each is
rated numerically, with higher numbers superior. Characters
may also have skills, such as pilot/navigator, gunner, medic,
driver, etc. Characters may possess certain items of equipment,
whose quality depends on the "Tech Code" (technology level),
or other items of worth, whose value depends on where they
are bought and sold.
The characters include yourself, the Star Smuggler Duke
Springer (see r201b), any followers in your crew or party, and
any other characters, creatures, or robots encountered during
the game. Characters can be friendly or hostile, intelligent or
unintelligent.
When a character joins your party, note his (or her) vital
statistics as needed. You can voluntarily dismiss or abandon
members of your party if you wish (sometimes expedient when
making an escape, or if money or equipment runs short).
Dismissal or abandonment may have penalties to you (r220b).
Characters encountered who don't join your party can be
ignored after the event, they simply go on their way, and
"disappear" from the game.
To determine your own personal characteristics at the start of
the game, see r201b.
