Repair Units

when [repairs](r219) are made after [damage](r217) or [breakdown](r218), 
you must expend Repair Units (RUs). One Repair
Unit occupies one CU of space, and is sufficient for one day of
repair on one item of equipment (see [RRR activity](r203c)).
Repair units are purchased in [various areas](r205), and are
sometimes acquired by events.
