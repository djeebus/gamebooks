# Hirelings

a person hired as a starship crewman must be paid "sign-on"
money sometimes, at the time of hiring. The daily or weekly
salary must be paid at the start of each day or week, and may
be modified if the crewman is working in a stasis unit with
insurance coverage. All costs are noted in event paragraphs,
and are normally modified by the wealth code of the system.
See [equipment used by hirelings](r223a).
If a salary is not paid in advance, at the start of each day you
can attempt to convince them to keep working anyway with a
[successful cunning roll](r202). If this fails, the character will
leave you as soon as he or she arrives in an area with good air.
Until that time, the person does not work, and will automatically
side against you in any encounter (join opposition in combat
against you, inform customs searches of contraband, etc.).
