# Carrying & Hiding Items

all persons, equipment and cargo occupy space, measured in
Capacity Units ([CUs](r211)). To carry an item, sufficient
CU-carrying ability is required. Any items not carrying carried by
party members, in one of your vehicles, or in a [cache](r229c)
are abandoned and lost. Materials in the starship must have the
storage location noted. The starship has six 1 CU hiding places
that can be used, as well as normal compartments. There are
no "hiding places" in other vehicles, in robots, or anywhere else
unless indicated in the event. Of course, an item in an activated
[stasis unit](r212e) cannot be observed or examined.
