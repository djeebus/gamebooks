# Characteristics and Skills

Marksmanship measures your ability to fire all [ranged
weapons](r230d) (sidearms, skimmer guns, etc.) except starship guns
(which require a special skill instead). The higher your rating,
the better you shoot. Ratings range from 0 to 6, if none is given,
assume a 0 rating.

Hand-to-hand measures your ability in close combat. The
higher your rating, the better. Ratings range from 0 to 6. This
hand-to-hand rating also [determines defense](r230g) against such
attacks.
