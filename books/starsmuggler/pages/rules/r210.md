# Vehicles & Equipment

There are various ways to travel, including on foot, and in
various vehicles. Vehicles include star ships, ship's boats, orbital
shuttles, commercial vehicles, and skimmers. You also have
access to a wide range of equipment, including weapons
(sidearms, heavy hand arms, skimmer guns, boat guns, and
starship guns), robots, utility suits, and other items.
Each item of equipment has a tech level ranging from 1 to 6.
When you find, purchase, or encounter someone using an item
of equipment, refer to the [Tech Level of Equipment](r235) table,
roll 1d6, and cross-reference the tech code of the system with
the roll. The table indicates the item's actual tech code, from 1
to 6. As a result, the tech code of the system will generally
suggest tech levels of items, but the table result can vary the
results.

Some Level of Equipment results show "1*" as the result. If
you encounter an individual with this result, they are unarmed,
and any fight will be hand-to-hand (230g); any other found or
purchased equipment is considered tech level 1.
Prices of equipment are noted in event paragraphs, when you
have the opportunity to buy or sell. [Wealth code](r229a) can affect
prices. There are [special costs](r220) associated with crewmen
and other hirelings, and the special costs for
your [starship bank payments](r203e).
