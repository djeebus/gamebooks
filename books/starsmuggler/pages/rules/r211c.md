# Fuel Units

a [ship's boat](r214) and [skimmer](r215c) require Fuel Units
(FUs) to operate. One FU occupies one CU of space. A ship's
boat cannot carry over 15 FU, and a skimmer cannot carry over
5 FU.
Star ships do not need [fuel units](r212), and when hiring
the use of orbital shuttles or commercial land vehicles you can
ignore FU needs â€” appropriate fuel is part of the hiring cost.
FUs are purchased in [various areas](r205), and are sometimes
acquired by events.
