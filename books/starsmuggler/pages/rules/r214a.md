# Storage

the Hopper class overall is 40 CU in size, and thus requires
that space inside a starship when being transported by a
starship. The internal capacity of the Hopper boat is 25 CU: 5
CU control & passenger compartment, and four other 5 CU
compartments. The passenger and control area will contain the
pilot, any other passengers, items they can carry including PS
robots, and/or LSUs. The other compartments may contain fuel,
passengers, or other items including boat guns (5 CU), LSUs,
etc.

One LSU per day will provide life support for everyone and
everything inside a Hopper class boat.
No more than 15 CUs of fuel (15 FU) may be on the boat at
any one time, since only three of the other compartments have
fuel fittings.
