# RRR — Rest, Recuperation & Repair

this action is allowed only if you spend a full day (all 10 hours)
doing it. No travel and no contact is allowed during an RRR day.
At the start of an RRR day, first [determine if an unwanted
contact occurs](r227a). If nothing happens, you can spend
the day [repairing equipment](r219) or [healing](r231). A
character cannot heal and repair at the same time, but some in
your party could be healing while others are involved in repair
work. If a repairman or mobile repairman is needed, you must
have already arranged to have him (or it) present during the
RRR day — searching for repairmen is not part of RRR.
