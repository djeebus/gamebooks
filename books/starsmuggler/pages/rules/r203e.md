# Loan Payments

at the end of each 10-day week, a loan payment is due on
your Antelope-class starship. The ship originally cost 120,000
Sees ([Sector Exchange Units](r232a), the "money" used here), 
and your loan for this amount is 300 S interest due each
10-day week. In addition to interest, you can also pay back any
part of the principal (the original 120,000 S) as well. Interest
payments do not reduce the principal, and even if you pay
some of the principal, interest continues at 300 S per 10-day
until the full principal is paid.

If you default on your loan (fail to pay interest) you have 30
days (three 10-day weeks) to pay the entire principal, after
which the loan company begins attempts to repossess the ship
(and appropriate events begin occurring!). Once you miss a
payment, you can't make up with just that payment — the
whole loan becomes due (the loan company are "sharks" — who
else would loan you so much?).

Incidentally, half the principal (60,000 S) is due ten years
hence, and the rest of the principal (another 60,000 S) is due
twenty years hence, but its unlikely you'll play long enough to
worry about this!

Using banks to hold some of your money, you can [have loan
payments made from your account](r232a) (in case you aren't around a
place with banks when the week is up).
