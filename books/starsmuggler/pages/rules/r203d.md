# Breakdown

at the end of each day, any vehicle or piece of equipment you
used may [break down](r218). [Preventive
maintenance](r218b) avoids the danger of breakdown.
Breakdown need not be checked for vehicles that didn't move
(even if providing life support and/or communications), or for
starships and boats in orbit or docked at a space station.
Breakdown of individual items (such as weapons) is separate
from any vehicle carrying them, or any other device.
