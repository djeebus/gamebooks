# Starship Engineer
a crewman who can perform preventive maintenance or make
repairs on any starship or ship's boat equipment, or on a
skimmer. He can drive a skimmer, but cannot pilot a starship or
ship's boat. He cannot use any weapons except sidearms (and
then only if he has marksmanship of 1 or more), and only
defends himself if attacked in hand-to-hand combat. As a
starship crewman he can operate communications equipment.
