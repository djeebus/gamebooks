# Abandonment, Insurance & Death Payments

a member of your party could leave due to an event, normal
end of employment, or Is simply left behind with life support or
in an area with good air â€” outside of a combat situation. Here
you have no further obligation to the person. If the person is
killed, abandoned in combat, or left without life support where it
is needed, you must make a death payment on that day or the
following day to a bank. If you don't make the payment on time,
you can never again hire anyone from the star system where
the person was hired, except those who don't require any death
payment.

Death payments can be deposited in advance at any bank in
the person's home system for an extra 10% fee. If the person
leaves your party and no death payment is needed, you can
recover the money the next time you are in an area with
banking facilities in that system.

Stasis insurance is obtained by installing a stasis unit in the
work space of the crewman (1 CU for a man alone, 2 CU for a
man with suit), and by depositing money sufficient for the next
largest size stasis unit plus 10% at any bank. Insurance money
is never refunded, regardless of circumstances when the person
leaves your employ. See [stasis unit details](r212e).
