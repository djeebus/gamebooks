# Starship Guns

these powerful energy beam weapons must be mounted in
starships, the Antelope class can fit one set of guns in its turret.
They can only be fired by a qualified starship gunner in the
turret. If starship guns are purchased, they are installed at that
time if the starship is present; otherwise a [starship engineer](r221b) 
can install them in [one day of RRR](r203c) devoted to the task.

A hit from starship guns reduces an individual's [Endurance](r231) 
by ten points, or [inflicts one hit](r230l) on a vehicle (may be a
critical hit).
