# Travel

during a normal day of travel and contact, you may travel
about the [land area](r204g). You have the following travel
options, provided the vehicle is present and available:

- Walk on foot: travel one land step per day, or spend an hour to
move to an adjacent (connected by triple line) area
- [Hire a commercial land vehicle](r215): one hour per land step.
- [Drive a skimmer](r215): if you own one, one hour per step.
- [Fly Ship's Boat](r214): 1/10 hour per step, 1 hour to go to or from
orbit/ space station.
- [Take the Orbital Shuttle](r215): 1 hour to or from space station or
spaceport, see r215 for details.
- [Pilot Starship](r212): 1/10 hour per step, 1 hour to or from orbit/space
station, can also travel between planets and
between star systems.

When you travel, each new area entered requires a [check for
detection](r225). You can travel more than once per day,
provided you have sufficient hours left for the next travel, and
you have [sufficient fuel](r211) and [life support](r213) where
necessary. You may alternate travel and contact activities in
the same day, provided sufficient time remains.
