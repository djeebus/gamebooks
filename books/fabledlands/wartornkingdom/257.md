The trees are closely packed, leaning together as if in conference,
whispering quietly among themselves. Birds twitter in the
distance, and slivers of sunlight lance down through the musty
gloom.
As you proceed along a forest track, you think you hear a
rustling in the bushes. Later, you spot a shadowy figure darting
through the trees â€“ or was it your imagination? An animal
snuffling sound right behind you makes you spin round, but
there is nothing there.
