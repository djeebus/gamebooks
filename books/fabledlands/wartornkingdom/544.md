The shrine is set in a wooded grove. Birds twitter in the trees,
and a deer darts away into the forest at you approach. A priestess
is tending a low altar, where food and drink has been laid out in
honour of Lacuna, the Goddess of the Wilderness. She is the
patron of hunters, trappers, woodsmen, and all those who seek
oneness with nature.
