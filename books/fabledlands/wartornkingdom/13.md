‘The Violet Ocean’s a dangerous place, Cap’n’, says the first
mate. ‘The crew probably won’t follow you there if they don’t
think you’re good enough!’

If your Rank is 4 or more, [turn to 55 in Over the Blood-Dark Sea](!require-rank!4!overthebloddarksea/55). 
If your Rank is less than 4, the first mate advises
you against the ocean journey. If you take his advice, [turn back
to 507](507).

If you insist on making the trip, you need to make a
[CHARISMA roll at Difficulty 12](!roll!charisma!12!overthebloddarksea/55!507) to convince the crew to follow
you. If you succeed, turn to paragraph 55 in Over the Blood-Dark
Sea. Otherwise, turn back to 507.
