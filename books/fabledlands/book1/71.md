Nagil is the Lord of the Lands of the Dead, and his temple in
Marlock City is covered in friezes and gargoyles of ornate
design, depicting the souls of the dead on their journey to the
underworld. Inside, it is cool and dark, hung with black velvet
drapes.

A scroll tacked to the wall reads: ‘Wanted: person of unusual
resourcefulness. See temple warden.’
