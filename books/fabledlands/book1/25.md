Captain Vorkung is impressed with your claims of loyalty to the
rightful king. He decides you might be useful to their cause, and
you are led, blindfolded, through a secret pass to a mountain
stockade.

King Nergan gives you an audience in a makeshift throne
room. He is a young, and handsome man, who seems
committed to his country. He leads you aside, into a private
chamber.

‘I have need of one such as you,’ he says. ‘Yellowport groans
under the yoke of Governor Marloes Marlock, the brother of
General Grieve Marlock. If you can get into the palace at
Yellowport and assassinate Marloes, I will be eternally grateful.’

If you have the codeword Artery, [turn to 399 immediately](!require-codeword!artery!399).
Otherwise, if you wish to accept the mission to kill the
Governor of Yellowport, [record the codeword Ambuscade](!gain-codeword!ambuscade).

When you are ready, the King wishes you well, and you are
lead out of the stockade, and back down to the foothills of the
Coldbleak Mountains. [Turn to 474](474).
