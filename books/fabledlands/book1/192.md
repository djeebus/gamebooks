During your short trip upward, the old man regales you with
tales of your destiny and fate, continuously arguing with himself
as he does so.

You reach a hill covered with a circle of large obsidian
standing stones. Despite the bitter wind that blow across these
hills the stones are unweathered and seem almost newly lain.

‘Here are the Gates of the World.’ says the mad old man.

The stones are laid in such a way that they form three
archways, each carven with mystic symbols and runes of power.

‘Each gate will take you to a part of the world of Harkuna,
though I know not where,’ explains the old man. Abruptly, he
turns around and sets off down the hill, babbling to himself. His
voice fades as he descends the hill, leaving you alone with the
brooding stones and the howling wind.
