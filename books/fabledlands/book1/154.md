The temple of Alvir and Valmir, Divine Rulers of the House of
the Sea, is right on the teeming harbour of Marlock City. Its
sea-green marbled porticos are draped in a hundred silver nets.
Brother and sister, Alvir and Valmir rule below the waves. Alvir
brings the souls of the drowned in his nets before his sister,
Valmir, for judgement.

A swaggering ship’s captain emerges from the temple, saying
to you in passing, ‘Never, I mean never go to sea without paying
your respects to the twin gods – unless ye want to sail through a
world of storms!’
