The temple of Alvir and Valmir is a white marble building with
a wide portico which gives a panoramic view of the harbour.
The air in the nave is cool and fresh after the blazing sunshine
outside.

Alvir and Valmir, the twin gods, are responsible for storms at
sea. Sailors believe they take the souls of the drowned down to
their halls beneath the vasty deep.
