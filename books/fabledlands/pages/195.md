The Trading Post is a small village, set up here by
enterprising settlers from the mainland. Its main export appears
to be furs from the forest.

The Mayor, a fat genial fellow, who greets you personally,
insists that one day the Trading Post will be a thriving town.
There is not a lot here yet, however: a small market, a quay, the
settlerâ€™s houses, and a shrine to Lacuna the Huntress, goddess of
nature.
