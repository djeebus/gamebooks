You are in a corridor, still facing East. You
move cautiously along it, until you get to a
similar door. There is no slot for a key, but there
are some levers on the wall to your right.
As you look at them, wondering which to try,
you feel the air move at your side. The Wizard
reappears. “Congratulations;” he says, “on
coming so far. I will tell you this – you must pull
not one, nor three, but two levers, in order to
open this door.” Will you choose:

- The left and middle levers? [Turn to 19](19)
- The middle and right levers? [Turn to 107](107)
- The left and right levers? [Turn to 140](140)
