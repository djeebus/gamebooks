You are in a narrow tunnel. It goes steadily
upwards, heading North, and then turns
West. You realise that the roof of the tunnel is
getting lower, and you are still climbing.

The tunnel suddenly turns North again, still
going upwards, and you are relieved when
the roof becomes higher again and you can
stand properly. You climb up, and after a few
minutes the floor levels off. You pass through a
narrow archway, and find yourself in a wide
passage, going North. [Turn to 139](139).
