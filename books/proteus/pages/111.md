The tunnel narrows, and you notice that it
seems to be getting colder. Quite soon, it turns
right, and it seems as though you are at a
dead-end. You are about to turn back when an
ominous rumbling warns you of danger. But it
is too late to do anything â€“ the ground is
opening beneath your feet. Do you possess a
Potion of Flying? If so, [turn to 112](!consume-item!flying-potion!112). Otherwise,
[turn to 128](128).
