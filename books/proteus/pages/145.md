The passage goes North, then almost immediately, 
East. You go East for some time,
until it turns South. Shortly it turns East
again, and you go East until you see an
opening on your right. It is dark beyond, and
you can make out nothing by the fight from
your torch. Will you:

- Investigate further? [Turn to 16](16)
- Ignore it and continue East? [Turn to 54](54)
