You continue for some way, until you find
that you cannot go any further. In front of you
is a stone wall; the wall looks too smooth to be
natural, and you search for hidden levers, but
find none. Nothing you can do will move the
wall, and you are about to return to the last
junction, and go North, when you realise that
there is a way South. If you wish to take this
new way South, [turn to 12](12). If you would
rather go back and head North, [turn to 42](42).
