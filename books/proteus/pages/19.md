You pull the levers. They do not move easily,
and it takes all your power to drag them out,
but you are rewarded by the sight of the door
opening.

You go into a large room. Suddenly remembering the Wizard, you clutch the Amulet and
turn. The Wizard is furious. He moves towards you, and as he does, so, his appearance
changes.

He is no longer an old man with a stooping
stature, but, as you watch, he grows tall,
towering above you. You realise that this is
BELENGHAST.

His robes have re-formed into the finest,
gleaming, chain-mail, and he wields a fearsome 
double-headed axe as he advances towards you,
spitting hate. You must quickly
choose to try: a Potion of Magic, if you have
one – [turn to 40](40), or else you must fight him
unaided – [turn to 141](141).
