At the dead GIANTâ€™s waist, you see a small
leather pouch. Inside is a silver key. Feeling
that this may be of use to you, you put it in
your pocket and continue North. Shortly, you

continue North, or take a new passage that
leads off to your right. Will you:

- Take the new passage East? [Turn to 3](3)
- Continue North? [Turn to 182](182)"""
