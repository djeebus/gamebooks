The eerie light from the rocks, together with
your torch, allows you to see quite well, and
ahead you can see that the passage bears
North. You continue for some little way,
watching and listening carefully, but all is
deathly silent. You turn North, still taking
great care, until you see that a passage runs off
to your right. Will you:

- Take the passage East? [Turn to 75](75)
- Continue North? [Turn to 146](146)
