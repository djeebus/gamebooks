You very soon turn East, and, after a short
time, North again. You walk along a well-lit
corridor, under an arch and into a small,
circular arena, the floor covered with sand.

You draw your sword, and as you do, the
fast of a dozen FACELESS WARRIORS enters
from under the arch behind you. You have
time to realise that you got the answer to the
wizard’s question wrong, as the FACELESS
WARRIORS surround you.

Each is immensely strong and fast. They are
the size of Giants, but more dextrous. Their
name derives from the fact that they are
entirely featureless: they have no eyes, no
mouth, no ears. As the first FACELESS WARRIOR 
closes for the kill, his mighty sword
buzzing past your ear, the others move in. You
will die bravely against Belenghast’s elite
troops, but your adventure ends here.
