Try as you may, you cannot keep your
footing, and you slide down the tunnel with
increasing speed, until you finally roll to a stop
on a bed of some spongy, slimy substance. You
have lost your torch in your headlong fall, but
you can now make out, by the dull-red glow
from the rocks, that you are in a pit. You
realise, with mounting honor, that what you
have landed on is a nest of dozens of huge
worms. Each is almost as long as you, and as
thick as your thigh. They begin coiling round
you, gripping as tight as snakes, and your
leather armour dissolves. The slime that oozes
from their bodies is acid, and is their way of
digesting their prey. You swing your sword
wildly, but to no avail â€“ your adventure has
ended here.
