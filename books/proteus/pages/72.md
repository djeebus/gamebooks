You are in a tunnel that goes North for some
time, then West for a while, then turns North
again. There are no other passages, and the air
is deathly quiet. Eventually, you arrive at
another turning: on your left, is what looks
like a stone wall barring the way, and so you
go East, until you see a passage to the North.
You try this new way North. [Turn to 42](42).
