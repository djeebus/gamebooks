You tell him that you wish to reach the
quarters of Belenghast, and ask him which
way to go next. He looks at you sidelong, and
says, “The safest way is to go East out of here,
take the first passage North, and then go
East.” But your intuition tells you that he is
lying, at least partly. You leave the room. You
may now [continue East](90) or go
[back West](10).
