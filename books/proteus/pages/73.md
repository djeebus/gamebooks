You go South for some way, but then the
passage turns West. Very soon, you pass
under a stone archway, and find yourself in a
small, square room. You move across, but as
you do, the floor suddenly tilts, throwing you
against the wall. As you regain your footing,
the floor begins moving from side to side, and
you are thrown to the floor again. The whole
room seems to be crashing about like a ship in
a storm. If you have a Potion of Flying, and
wish to use it here, [turn to 184](184). 
Otherwise [turn to 125](125).
