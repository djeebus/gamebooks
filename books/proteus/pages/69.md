You take two steps back, raise your shield to
your shoulder, and hurl yourself at the door. It
splinters into fragments, and you stumble into
a tiny room.

You look about you. The floor is stoneflagged,
the walls are solid, it seems that you
are in an empty room. But as you are about to
leave, you become aware of a faint noise, like
glass gently tinkling. There is nothing to be
seen, but as you stand there, the sounds form
into a faint, glittering voice inside your head.
“Go North, and then West,” the voice seems
to say.

You shake your head, wondering at this,
and leave the room, going North. [Turn to 66](66).
