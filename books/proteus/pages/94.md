The chest opens easily. Inside is a single
piece of old parchment. It is so old that it looks
as though it would crumble to dust if you were
to touch it, but by the light of your torch, you
can just make out the words written on it. You
read:

> Bi Netherig evelin Oen,

> Orovath y Han to ther,

> Metheniken, baragrathen, ü

> ty vathen elen pir.”

If you have a potion of Intuition, and wish to
use it now, you may do so – [turn to 108](!must-have-item!intuition-potion!108).
Otherwise, you may either go over to the wall
to read the inscription on the plaque – [turn to 195](195) – or 
you may leave and continue West: [Turn to 89](89).
