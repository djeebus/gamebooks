Very soon, the natural fight from the rocks
dies away, and you go forward more slowly.
You feel a chilly wind on your face, and as you
press on, the wind becomes stronger and
colder, until it is howling about your ears, and
you have to bend into it to make any progress.
Your torch is extinguished like a candle, and
you are fumbling forwards in total blackness,
your hands outstretched.

Another hand takes yours: but it is ice-cold.
You try to release your grip but cannot. You cut
and slash into the darkness, but make no
contact with anything, and you are dragged
into the eternal cold darkness by the invisible
Hand of Death.

You have failed in your quest.
