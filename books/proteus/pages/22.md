You open the door. It is pitch-black beyond,
and you hold your torch high as you step
warily forwards. You have taken only three
steps before you step off, and plummet into a
pit of boiling sulphur. Your dying screams
echo in the blackness, but there is no-one to
hear them. Your adventure ends here.
