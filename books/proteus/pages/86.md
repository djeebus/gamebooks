The passage East turns South quite soon,
and then goes Eastwards. You notice that the
temperature is rising. You continue East, until
the passage goes North. You follow the passage 
North for some while, and all the time
the heat is getting worse.

Soon the sweat is running into your eyes,
and you are beginning to feel exhausted. A
strange buzzing noise becomes louder as you
continue, until something flies into your face â€“
it is a fly. You wave it away irritably, but within
seconds there are hundreds of them, each
nearly half an inch long, flying into your ears
and nose and mouth! Despite the heat and
your exhaustion, you run desperately North,
until you are free of the horrible things.

As you continue, you are relieved that the
temperature seems to be dropping again, and
continues to do so until it is quite pleasantly
cool.

You see a passage on your left, but ignore it. [Turn to 178](178).
