You walk along the passage for some minutes 
without incident, until you find that your
way onwards is barred. The tunnel appears to
be a dead-end. Standing back, you can see by
the light of your torch that what bars your way
is in fact a large boulder. You can make out a
space between the top of the boulder and the
tunnel roof, and you try at first to climb over.
But the boulder is smooth, and you cannot get
a hand-hold. After several failed attempts,
you realise you will have to try something
else. Have you got a Potion of Flying? If so,
[turn to 133](133). Otherwise, [turn to 138](138).
