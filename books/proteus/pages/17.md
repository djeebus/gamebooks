Your foot catches on a wire â€“ and a hidden
trap is sprung. The way behind you is closed
off by a wall of rock, and a rumbling noise
makes you look up. You realise that the ceiling
of the tiny room you are trapped in is steadily
descending. You push against it with all your
might, but it continues its relentless descent,
and you will finally be crushed like an insect,
lost in the depths of the Tower of Terror.
