You travel East for what seems like a long
time. The passage narrows and becomes
colder. You soon pass under a stone archway,
and find yourself in a small, square room. As
you begin to walk across, the floor suddenly
tilts, and you are thrown against the wall. You
stand up again, but now the floor is moving
from side to side, as well as rocking and tilting
like a ship in a storm. If you have a potion of
Flying, and wish to use it here, [turn to 160](!must-have-item!flying-potion!160).
Otherwise [turn to 121](121).
