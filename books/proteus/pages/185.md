The door seems to be locked. You take a
pace back and give the door a straight kick, as
taught you by Eleutheria. It crashes away from
its hinges, and you brush it aside to find
yourself in a very small, seemingly empty,
room.

You are about to leave, since there is nothing 
of value, when you hear a strange sound,
like glass tinkling. You stop, and look, but
there is nothing to be seen. As you stand
there, the sound becomes more rhythmic, and
starts to form a pattern. It is, you feel, a voice,
and as you strain to listen, the crystal sounds
suddenly take shape in your mind:

“Go North, and then West,” says the voice.
You remember this, wondering whether or
not to believe it, and leave the room, going
North. [Turn to 66](66).
