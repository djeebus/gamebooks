After a short while, the tunnel turns East.
You keep going, but the tunnel stops after a
short time at what seems to be a dead-end.
You feel around the wall, looking for levers or
secret passages. There is a click â€“ you must
have touched something. You hear a grating
sound from behind, and turn to see a slab of
solid rock slide across. You will end your days
walled up in this tomb in the Tower of Terror.
