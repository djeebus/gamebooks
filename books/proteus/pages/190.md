The door opens into a tiny room. There is a
stone bed against the wall, and a broken
wooden chair, but nothing else. You are about
to leave, when you notice some writing carved
into the wall opposite, and you go closer to see
what it says. You read:

> “There was another such as you,
> he holds the Amulet of Stone –
> and keeps it safe for others who
> will venture further – quite alone.”

You puzzle over the meaning of this rhyme,
before leaving to go North again. [Turn to 173](173).
