The passage goes North for a time, but then
turns East. You continue East, watching for
traps, but all is quiet, and soon the passage
turns North again.

The passage ends at a door, and as you
consider what approach to take now, the door
swings open on its own. You go through, and
at once the door closes behind you. Ahead of
you there are two more doors, one on the 
left-hand side of the wall opposite, and one on the
right. Between the doors, and above them, a
piece of parchment bears the words: “One
door is death, the other, life.”

As you watch, two SPRITES appear. The
SPRITES look at you – they are elfin creatures,
but you are wary. You have heard stories of
their dangerous tricks, and you know that
when they appear in pairs, one of them
always Ges, and the other tells the truth. But
there is no way, from looking at them, that
you can tell which is which.

One of the SPRITES takes up position in
front of the left-hand door, and one stands in
front of the right. They may disappear into
thin air at any second, so you quickly ask the
one before the right-hand door,

“Are you a Gar?”

“One of us,” he says smugly, “is certainly a
liar. Or perhaps we both are!”

Quickly you ask,

“Is the door behind you the door to life?” As
they shimmer and disappear, you can just
make out his answer – “Yes,” floating in the
air.

Now, will you take:

- The left-hand door? [Turn to 22](22)
- The right-hand door? [Turn to 143](143)
