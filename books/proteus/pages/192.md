The door opens easily. You are in a very
small room, which contains nothing but a
broken wooden chair and a stone bed. But
some writing carved into the wall opposite
catches your eye, and you look to see what it
says. You read:

> “There was another such as you,
> he holds the Amulet of Stone –
> and keeps it safe for others who
> will venture further – all alone.”

You are not sure whether this is a warning,
or useful information, but you memorise the
words before leaving to go South again. [Turn to 7](7).
