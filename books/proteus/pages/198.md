You move, exhausted, to the great corpse,
and find, around his neck, a diamond and
sapphire. You realise that these must be the
two jewels from the Temple of Valadon, that
Golfreth told you of. You go back out of the
room, your sword at the ready, but all is quiet.

You go back down the stone staircase, and
continue, past the cell that held Swiftfoot, and
on down. No creature bars your way: now
that BELENGHAST is dead, his power is lost,
and his creatures have shrivelled back into the
evil half-world they came from.

You eventually get back to the entrance to
the Tower of Terror, and are amazed to see that
the sun is just setting. You hold up the
diamond and sapphire, and shout, “I have the
two jewels from the Temple of Valadon!”

The town gradually becomes quiet. Someone 
moves towards you and you reach for
your sword – but then you recognise him as
Golfreth, now reformed as a whole man
again. Golfreth takes the jewels, thanking you
quietly, and walks into the rained Temple.
