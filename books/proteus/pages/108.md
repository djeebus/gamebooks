The potion begins working, and the strange
words change and re-form before you; you
read:

> Return, go North, and then go West

> Release the man enchained in fear.

> Do not attack or harm him lest

> You take his place above you here.

- Return: [Turn to 54](54)
- Continue West? [Turn to 89](89)
- Look at the plaque set into the wall? [Turn to 195](195)
