You go through the door. You are in a tunnel
facing North, but it at once turns East, and,
after a short time, goes South. You continue
South, but the passage now turns East again,
and you follow it until you reach a dead-end.

Looking closer, you can see that what is in
front of you is actually a slab or rock. There are
two levers set in the wall, and it looks as
though one of them might open the rock-slab.
Will you try:

- The left-hand lever? [Turn to 84](84)
- The right-hand lever? [Turn to 149](149)
